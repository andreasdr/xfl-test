# xfl-test
This is just a small XFL demonstration application. This is not complete yet, but a start.
See https://github.com/andreasdr/xfl

It sometimes may not be 100% working due to OpenFL or XFL changes. 
If you want to see it in action still just drop me a line.

It uses default skinning from Adobe Animate CC and currently involves
- XFL movie clip asset loading and creation
- CheckBox
- ProgressBar
- RadioButton
- ScrollBar
- Slider
- TextArea
- TextField

To run it you have to clone XFL in parent folder and create symlinks using
- ./symlink-xfl.sh

To finally run the test for browser target do
- openfl test project-test-xfl.xml html5
